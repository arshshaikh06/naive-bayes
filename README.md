# Naive-Bayes using Java

## About

A program to perform naive-bayes classification algorithm using plain java code.

The code is dynamic for different datasets as long as all columns in the dataset are used and the last column is the result.

**Note:** For datasets not involving the first or first few columns such as the 3rd dataset example, change the iterations as commented in the code.
